### Intro
- Virtual machines trick the computer into thinking that it is running that operating system.
- M1 mac has a lot of overhead when running virtual machines.
- Computers turn information into heat.
#### Von Neumann Architecture
- Fetches instructions from RAM to execute.
- Those instructions can further modify other RAM locations
- Self-modifying code is possible, although modern implementations make it painfully slow to use.
- Also known as the stored program 
- Code and Data in the same space. Some data in ram are code and some are data.
- In contrast the "Harvard architecture" has specific memory for code "code" and for "data".

### Operating systems
- An operating system is a software that manages software
	- What makes it different from other programs is the things that we ask it to do and where in the system it lies.

- A resource is a finite thing that the operating system would like to use.
	- Time is also a critical resource in operating systems.

- An operating system abstracts details.
